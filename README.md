# 1. Conditional WGAN (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) {#1-conditional-wgan-wasserstein-gan-with-gradient-penalty}

**Training Process:**

**Objective:** Uses the Wasserstein distance as a loss function to
provide smoother gradients and improve training stability. Gradient
Penalty: Adds a gradient penalty term to enforce the Lipschitz
constraint, replacing weight clipping from the original WGAN.
Conditional Generation: Incorporates class labels into the generator and
discriminator to produce class-specific outputs. Challenges:

**Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Requires careful tuning of the gradient
penalty coefficient (λ) and learning rates. Computational Overhead:
Calculating the gradient penalty increases training time.

**Training Stability:** While improved, training can still be unstable
without proper settings.

# 2. SNGAN (Spectral Normalization GAN) {#2-sngan-spectral-normalization-gan}

**Training Process:**

**Spectral Normalization: **Applies spectral normalization to the
discriminator\'s weights to control the Lipschitz constant, enhancing
stability without additional penalty terms.

**Simplified Training**: Eliminates the need for gradient penalties or
weight clipping.

**Challenges:**

**Implementation Complexity:** Incorporating spectral normalization
requires modifying the weight update rules.

**Generator Training:** Spectral normalization is typically applied only
to the discriminator, so the generator may still experience instability.

# 3. SAGAN without Spectral Normalization {#3-sagan-without-spectral-normalization}

**Training Process:**

**Self-Attention Mechanism:** Introduces self-attention layers to model
long-range dependencies in images, improving the generator\'s ability to
capture complex structures.

**Standard GAN Loss:** Uses conventional GAN loss functions without
additional normalization. Challenges:

**Training Instability:** Without spectral normalization or gradient
penalties, the model is prone to mode collapse and unstable training.
Increased Complexity: The addition of self-attention layers increases
the model\'s complexity, making convergence harder to achieve.

# 4. SAGAN with Spectral Normalization and TTUR (Two-Time-Scale Update Rule) {#4-sagan-with-spectral-normalization-and-ttur-two-time-scale-update-rule}

Training Process:

**Spectral Normalization: **Stabilizes the discriminator by normalizing
the weights, ensuring controlled gradient flow. Self-Attention
Mechanism: Enhances the model\'s capacity to generate detailed and
coherent images.

**TTUR:** Uses different learning rates for the generator and
discriminator to balance their updates and improve convergence.
Challenges:

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Selecting appropriate learning rates for both
networks requires experimentation.

**Computational Demand:** The combination of self-attention and spectral
normalization increases computational requirements. Implementation
Complexity: Integrating multiple advanced techniques necessitates
careful coding and debugging.

# Comparison Table of FID and IS Scores after Training for 20,000 Epochs

Below is a table you can use in Google Colab to compare the Fréchet
Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) of the models after
training for 20,000 epochs.

#Present Analysis

#Conditional WGAN (300 epochs):

FID Score: The extremely high FID score indicates a significant
divergence between the generated and real data distributions. This
suggests that the model failed to produce realistic images. Inception
Score: An IS of 55.4 is unusually high and may indicate an error in
calculation, as typical IS values for CIFAR-10 models range between 5
and 9. Interpretation: Training for only 300 epochs may not have been
sufficient for the model to learn effectively. Additionally, there might
be issues in the implementation or metric computation that need to be
addressed.

#SNGAN:

FID Score: Achieved a score of 43.622, indicating moderate similarity to
the real data distribution. Inception Score: An IS of 6.176 suggests
that the generated images have reasonable quality and diversity.
Interpretation: Spectral normalization in the discriminator helps
stabilize training, leading to better performance compared to the
Conditional WGAN.

#SAGAN without Spectral Norm:

FID Score: With a score of 39.886, it slightly outperforms SNGAN in
terms of similarity to real images. Inception Score: An IS of 6.399 ±
0.10431 indicates improved image quality and diversity. Interpretation:
The self-attention mechanism allows the model to capture long-range
dependencies, enhancing image generation despite the absence of spectral
normalization.

#SAGAN with Spectral Norm and TTUR:

FID Score: The higher score of 81.759840 suggests poorer performance in
matching the real data distribution. Inception Score: An IS of 3.93455
is lower than the other models, indicating less diversity and quality.
Interpretation: Despite the theoretical advantages, the combination may
not have been effectively leveraged due to potential issues like
improper hyperparameter settings or insufficient training epochs.
Overall Observations
`<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Zf6gxFM/04.png" alt="04" border="0">`{=html}

**Best Performing Model:** Based on the FID and IS scores, SAGAN without
Spectral Norm demonstrated the best performance among the models tested.
Importance of Hyperparameters: The results emphasize that hyperparameter
choices, such as learning rates and the number of training epochs,
critically impact model performance.

#Future Work

To enhance the models and achieve better results, the following steps
are recommended:

Hyperparameter Optimization:

**Learning Rates:** Experiment with different learning rates for the
generator and discriminator, especially when using TTUR, to find a
balance that promotes stable training. Training Epochs: Increase the
number of epochs, particularly for the Conditional WGAN, to allow the
model more time to learn the data distribution. Data Diversity:

**Augmentation Techniques:** Apply data augmentation to increase the
variety of training examples, helping the model generalize better and
reduce overfitting. Loss Function Exploration:

**Alternative Losses:** Investigate other loss functions like the hinge
loss or Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty for models where they
haven\'t been applied. Model Architecture Refinement:

**Spectral Normalization Application:** Re-evaluate the implementation
of spectral normalization in SAGAN with Spectral Norm and TTUR to ensure
it\'s correctly applied across all necessary layers.

**Attention Mechanisms:** Explore different configurations of
self-attention layers to maximize their effectiveness. Extended
Training:

**Longer Training Duration:** Allow models more training time to
potentially improve convergence and performance, monitoring for
overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics Validation:

Metric Computation: Verify the calculations of FID and IS scores to
ensure accuracy, especially when encountering anomalous values like in
the Conditional WGAN results. Regularization Techniques:

Implementing the suggested future work will not only address the current
challenges but also contribute to a deeper understanding of GAN training
dynamics. This, in turn, can pave the way for developing more robust
generative models capable of producing even more realistic and varied
images.
